  summary: local scheduler for heterogenous jobs
  description: |
    aitch (pronounced like the letter H) implements a light-weight
    cluster-style scheduler for use on a single workstation. Unlike parallel,
    xargs, and other similar utilities, which presume that all jobs use
    the same amount of resources, aitch permits one to request a different
    amount from an arbitrary number of unique kinds of resources. In effect
    it implements a counting semaphore for each resource and provides a
    means to adjust their values by non-negative integers.
